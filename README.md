📦 DocShip: International Document Courier App✨ OverviewDocShip is a complete, end-to-end web application that streamlines the process of sending documents from the USA to India using major couriers like FedEx or UPS. It features a guided, multi-step workflow covering estimation, smart address parsing, secure payment processing, and final label generation.🚀 Key FeaturesDocShip is designed for efficiency and user experience, focusing on error reduction and progress persistence.1. Shipment EstimationInput: Users select Shipping Type (Document), Source (USA), Destination (India), and enter the 5-digit U.S. ZIP and 6-digit Indian PIN.Validation: The backend validates both the ZIP and PIN (PINs are restricted to supported city ranges).Output: Returns the final Price (in INR + USD) and guaranteed Delivery Days (FedEx: 5 days, UPS: 7 days).2. Smart Address Parser (Auto-Extraction)This feature dramatically speeds up the address entry process:Users can paste a full, multi-line, or single-line address into a field.The parser instantly extracts and populates the forms for both U.S. Pickup and Indian Destination addresses, including: Name, Phone, Address Line 1, City, State, ZIP/PIN, and Aadhaar (if present).3. State Persistence & ResetLocal Storage Persistence: All progress (Current Step, form data, estimate, tracking, etc.) is automatically saved to localStorage['docshipData']. This allows the user to refresh the page or close the browser without losing their progress.Reset: The Reset button clears all React state and removes the localStorage entry, returning the app to Step 1 for a completely new shipment.🛠️ Technology Stack & ArchitectureDocShip follows a decoupled architecture, using React for the presentation layer and a simple Node/Express server for backend functions.Frontend (React)Framework: React (Functional Components).State Management: useState and useEffect hooks, fully mirrored to Local Storage.Key Logic: Address parsing logic, multi-step navigation, and input validation (validations.js).Components: App.js, CheckoutForm.js, PaymentModal.js, ShippingLabel.js, stepNavigator.js.Backend (Node.js + Express)Framework: Node.js with Express.Database: Simulated using JSON File Storage (shipments.json and payments.json).Core Responsibilities: Processing estimation, validating location codes, saving records, and generating unique Tracking Numbers and Payment Reference IDs.📁 Project Structuredocship/

📦 API EndpointsThe frontend communicates exclusively via these three API endpoints running on the backend server.MethodEndpointPurposeOutputPOST/api/estimateReturns shipping price and delivery days.JSON payload: {"price": 4500.00, "days": 5}POST/api/save-shipmentStores shipment data and generates a tracking number.JSON payload: {"tracking": "DS123456"}POST/api/save-paymentStores payment data and generates a unique reference.JSON payload: {"paymentRef": "PMT99881"}🧪 Validation and Business RulesThe application enforces strict data quality rules, particularly for geographical codes.FieldRuleImplementation NoteZIP (USA)Exactly 5 digits.Frontend and Backend validation.PIN (India)Exactly 6 digits.Frontend and Backend validation. Must fall within a list of supported city ranges (displayed via modal).PaymentSaves Card Number, Name, Expiry, CVV.This is a prototype; actual implementation requires a secure PCI-compliant gateway.🛠️ How to Run the ProjectTo run the DocShip application locally, you must start both the frontend and backend servers.1. Backend SetupThe backend must be running first to handle API calls.Bash# In your terminal:
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
Server Note: The backend will be listening for API requests at http://localhost:5000.2. Frontend SetupStart the React development server.Bash# In a new terminal window:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Client Note: The application will open in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.📌 Future Enhancements (Roadmap)Integrate additional couriers (DHL, etc.).Implement real-time API calls to courier services (e.g., FedEx/UPS APIs) for live pricing.Develop auto-detection of the target country from an address paste.Enable PDF generation for the final shipping label.Add user authentication and shipment history functionality.
